Narakeet helps you create narrated videos quickly.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.198
You can now automatically create poster images, to use as covers or

00:12.398 --> 00:14.977
thumbnails when publishing videos.

00:15.659 --> 00:18.158
When making a video from a presentation, just edit the settings, and

00:18.358 --> 00:20.857
look for the poster setting at the bottom.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.550
Narakeet can create the poster image from the first or last frame, or

00:23.750 --> 00:26.241
for videos that have an intro or outro section, use an image close to

00:26.441 --> 00:28.931
the start or the end.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.740
When the video build completes, click the "Get Poster" button at the

00:30.940 --> 00:32.541
bottom.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.290
Your browser will download the poster image to the local device, so

00:35.490 --> 00:38.039
you can easily publish it with your video.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.247
Users that create videos from Markdown scripts or using our API can

00:41.447 --> 00:44.455
set the poster image using the poster time header.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.491
